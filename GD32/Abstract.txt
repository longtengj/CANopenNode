The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS RTOS Kernel based example for the
GigaDevice 'GD32F32150C8' microcontroller using 'GD321x0C-START' evaluation board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =     8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =    72.00 MHz

The simple RTX Kernel based example simulates the step-motor
driver. Four LEDs are blinking simulating the activation of
the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and
CW rotation direction.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:

  GD32F150C8 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                       (used for production or target debugging)
